## About Bernstein's Stuff
As the subtitle implies, this collection represents a small sample of items from IU's Leonard Bernstein Collection. Items in this collection were selected based on popularity amongst library patrons and staff. 

## About IU's Leonard Bernstein Collection
The <a href="https://music.indiana.edu/about/cook-music-library/bernstein.html">Leonard Bernstein Collection</a> is held by Indiana University’s William and Gayle Cook Music Library. It was donated in 2009 and contains over 2000 items from Bernstein’s composition studio in Fairfield, CT. A portion of the collection is on public display at the Cook Music Library, and the entire collection is viewable on request for any interested patron. A complete finding aid for the collection can be found on <a href="https://archives.iu.edu/catalog/VAD8042">IU Archives Online</a>.

## Why call it "stuff"?
Phil Ponella, director of the William and Gayle Cook Music Library, explains why he calls much of this collection's contents "stuff":
